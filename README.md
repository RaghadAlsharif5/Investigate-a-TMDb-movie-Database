# Investigate-a-TMDb-movie-Database

This project made use of the TMDb movie Dataset, which contains approximately 10,000 movies gathered from TMDb. Each movie included information on its user rating, income, actors, genres, and so on. The purpose of this analysis is to examine information about movie features in order to help the movie industry earn more money.


The project's steps are as follows:

Evaluate the Data: Save and upload the file.
Data Wrangling: Remove unnecessary data such as empty and duplicate values.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Study statistics and create visualizations to identify the relationships between variables.
Communicate the results: Use findings to answer questions, then write a conclusion.
